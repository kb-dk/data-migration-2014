	<h2>The future</h2>

	<p>To us, the Sjauiga project represents two things: First,
	and foremost, an attempt to rescue previously independent sets
	of data and make them possible to present to users within the
	framework for our content management system. In the <a href="http://udvikling.kb.dk/sjauiga/implementation.plan.html#intro.problems">original
	plan we stated</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>We propose that this is done for the purpose of
	cleaning the data and for generating a viewer that can operate
	inside the new web site with the technology available
	there. However we also propose that we should evaluate METS
	for a wider deployment in our digitization
	projects.</blockquote>

	<p>That is, we proposed that while we used the package of
	technology described in this document for solving an acute and
	imminent, the intention was also to gather experience on
	possible alternative routes as regards storing and retrieving
	data from <em>heterogenous sources</em> on digitized objects</p>

	<h3>Visions</h3>

	<p>While METS and MODS obviously did the job on a technical
	level, we still have to think on the whens an whys we this
	format, or a format like it, would be beneficial.</p>

	<p>We start by taking a birds view on the services
	publish. They range from services providing little more than
	images that may be browsed (such as the sheet music stored as
	PDF files in REX) to POMA via services like MANUS,
	tidskrift.dk and Archive for Danish Literature.</p>

	<p>The sheet music in REX contain virtually no textual
	information what so ever and the only user interface is Adobe
	Acrobrat. Searching is impossible and the only way to find
	ones way to a certain piece of content is through
	browsing. The Gustaf Munch Petersen and Poma on the other hand
	has several table of contents, focusing on different aspects
	of the work, there are digital images in high resolution and
	finally the text is available in transcription. Finally there
	are various amount of related information that may be of
	interest for the target audience.</p>

	<p>When we move from the stuff containing the images only to
	the complex services, we find more and more data and more and
	more data of different type; first elementary metadata
	identifying the object, then structural metadata describing
	the relations <em>between</em> content objects inside a work,
	then to correlations between different instances of the same
	work (full text and images) and finally correlations and
	relations between different works.</p>

	<p>The power of mets is as an object with high linking
	power.</p>

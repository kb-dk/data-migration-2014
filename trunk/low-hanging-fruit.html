	<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>

	<p>The history of The Royal Library's Digitization programs and Web
	exhibition stretches some 15-20 years. Much of the material is no
	longer in shape for structured migration to modern platforms unless
	very substantial resources are spent on it. This document tries to
	identify material that are possible to migrate at a lower cost, but
	still would make a difference. Basically, we want to cherry-pick
	worthwhile objects.</p>

	<p>Below we list resources that are fairly structured to begin with,
	stuff that are interesting and that were well made by competent
	people. </p>

	<p>The material that are omitted below are either in too poor condition
	but could just be forgotten. That stuff isn't on the list doesn't
	imply poor quality, it just means that it is to hard a work to save these <a
	href="#tooexpensive">web exhibitions</a>. In addition some of
	this material is now available from the way-back machine.</p>


	<p>We list the material under a series of headings or criteria for (or
	against migration).</p>

	<p>We are look forward to input, corrections and proposals.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
	<h2 id="criteria">2. Criteria</h2>

	<div>
	  <h3 id="intimp">2.1. Interesting, important</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>H.C. Andersen's Dagbøger, a part of <a
	    href="http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/web_udstil/hca.html">H.C. Andersen
	    on-line</a> which is in Way-back machine. The links into the site
	    are either dead or obscure. If you're lucky you can actually <a
	    href="http://base.kb.dk/hca_pub/cv/main/Oversigt.xsql?nnoc=hca_pub">surf
	    into the proper site</a>. There is a backup of the original files
	    somewhere on a DVD.</li>

	    <li><a
	    href="http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm">The Guaman Poma Website</a></li>

	  </ul>

	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3 id="costly">2.2. Cost of maintenance</h3>

	  <p>Any document delivery is costly. However, it is more so if
	  material are delivered from custom built no longer supported
	  software. The so-called Trigono web apps were made individually for
	  each edition. Any change in user interface or metadata profile were
	  made in Cumulus and then deployed manually on a per edition
	  basis.</p>

	  <p>After COP we basically only three left.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://dia-prod-mas-01.kb.dk/FloraDanica/Site/index.jsp">Flora Danica</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://dia-prod-mas-01.kb.dk/Referencevaerker/Site/index.jsp">Referenceværker</a></li>

	  </ul>

	  <p>Of these we feel that Flora Danica and Referenceværker belongs in SIFD</p>

	</div>


	<div>
	  <h3 id="costofrecreation">2.3. Cost of (re-)creation</h3>

	  <p>Some material is created by skilled staff whose time is now
	  occupied elsewhere, or which might be hard to come by again. Good
	  examples are:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <a
	      href="http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/materialer/haandskrifter/HA/e-mss/index.html">Manuscript
	      collection</a>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <a href="http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/samling/ma/digmus">Digital Sheet
	      Music</a>. In this collection there are many files in PDF and <a
	      href="#rejuvenate">DjVu</a> formats which in addition are
	      fragile since there is a too <a href="#fragilemetadata">weak
	      connection between metadata and data</a>. These were mainly
	      created by the late Jens Egeberg.
	      <ul>

	  <h3 id="rejuvenate">2.4. Aging or obsolete formats</h3>

	  <p>It is problematic to use, run and maintain data in formats or
	  using software or both that are no longer supported by their
	  vendors.</p>

	  <h4>EREZ and Flash</h4>

	  <p>EREZ offered an opportunity to publish documents as flash
	  movies. Our EREZ license expired years ago, and the image server is
	  about to be replaced with another product which cannot do page
	  browsing.</p>

	  <p>There are some important stuff in this format.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <a
	      href="http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/materialer/haandskrifter/HA/e-mss/klaus_rifbjerg">Klaus
	      Rifbjerg</a>. See for example <a
	      href="http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/materialer/haandskrifter/HA/e-mss/klaus_rifbjerg/konfrontation.html">Konfrontation</a>. The
	      table of contents is stored in a directory inside the Erez
	      server area.
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>The material has been produced by OJA and HA and a rough
	  guesstimate yields that there are around 300 of these</p>

	  <h4>DjVu</h4>

	  <p>Some stuff are delivered in <a href="http://djvu.org/">DjVu format</a>. The plug-in isn't that
	  easy to get hold of and neither is easy to install.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <a
	      href="http://wayback-01.kb.dk/wayback/20100902124914/http://www2.kb.dk/kb/dept/nbo/kob/Fr5Atlas/forside.htm">Frederik
	      den Femtes Atlas</a>
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <h4 id="xsql">XSQL</h4>

	  <p>Oracle XSQL was an early framework for delivery of XML to
	  users. No longer supported by its vendor.</p>

	  <ul>

	    <li><a
	    href="http://illustrerettidende.dk/iti_pub/cv/main/Forside.xsql?nnoc=iti_pub">Illustreret
	    Tidende</a></li>

	    <li><a href="http://www.adl.dk/">ADL</a></li>

	  </ul>

	</div>

	<div>

	  <h3 id="fragilemetadata">2.5. Fragile connection between metadata and data</h3>

	  <p>A lot of material has been digitized by library staff, published
	  as image or PDF via file systems on servers like img.kb.dk and
	  images.kb.dk and subsequently cataloged in Aleph. This procedure has
	  in retrospect proved to be a poor practice since the connection
	  between metadata and data is too fragile, since the items links used
	  in our CMS and the ones cataloged in Aleph must be maintained
	  manually.</p>

	  <p>The 42,800 hits from the search</p> 

	  <pre>
	    <a
	  href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_q=&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=tidsskriftdk&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;lr=&amp;cr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_sitesearch=img.kb.dk&amp;as_occt=any&amp;safe=images&amp;tbs=&amp;as_filetype=pdf&amp;as_rights=">-tidsskriftdk site:img.kb.dk filetype:pdf</a>
	  </pre>

	  <p>should give an idea on the magnitude of the problem. (removing
	  the -tidsskriftdk constraint gives 56,900 hits).</p>

	  <p>There are other materials with fragile connection between
	  metadata and object. Quite a few of the EREZ and Flash objects
	  mentioned above belong to this category. Consider the result of this
	  <a
	  href="http://rex.kb.dk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?ct=Next+Page&amp;pag=nxt&amp;indx=91&amp;dscnt=0&amp;frbg=&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28KGL%29&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;dstmp=1396608583292&amp;srt=rank&amp;ct=Next%20Page&amp;mode=Basic&amp;dum=true&amp;indx=81&amp;tb=t&amp;vl%281UIStartWith0%29=contains&amp;vl%28764319501UI1%29=all_items&amp;vl%28747109341UI0%29=any&amp;vl%28freeText0%29=ha%20e-mss&amp;vid=KGL&amp;fn=search">search
	  in REX</a>. The lion's share of the material is from the manuscript
	  collection's flash/erez objects. There perhaps another 100 specimens
	  from the oriental collections. </p>

	  <h3 id="development">2.6. Potential for development</h3>

	  <p>See also <a href="#costofrecreation">Cost of (re-)creation</a> above.</p>

	  <p>The delivery system which sometimes is called permalink (which
	  doesn't really have a name) contains multipage documents whose
	  structure is described using METS. Migrating them to SIFD would give
	  us an opportunity to develop a structured datamodel for such
	  content. There are around 2800 objects of this kind.</p>

	  <p>They could also be a starting point for another, richer type of
	  manuscript cataloging based on TEI</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li><a
	    href="http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/materialer/haandskrifter/HA/e-mss/clh.html">CODICES
	    LATINI HAUNIENSES</a></li>

	    og renæssance</a></li>
	  </ul>
 

	  <p>Since KB doesn't have a system for the handling of finding aids,
	  such material are found elsewhere. If we wanted to create a
	  datamodel for such material, we could start with this archival
	  description.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/manus/692/dan/">Karen
	    Blixen: Arkivregistratur</a></li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>The catalog over incunabula at the Royal Library is an
	  interesting representation of a traditional printed catalog.</p>

	  <p>There are data around that could improve user experience for
	  person and agent LOD URI space</p>

	<h2 id="tooexpensive">3. Hard and too expensive to migrate</h2>

	<p>There are many digital exhibitions and interesting web sites in the
	wayback machine, that could perhaps get a new life. The cost to get a
	sites like <a href="http://www2.kb.dk/elib/danperi/">old periodica
	exhibitions</a> or <a
	href="http://www2.kb.dk/kultur/expo/sk-mss//mss-lst1.htm">Søren
	Kierkegaard Manuscript exhibition</a> up and running might not be
	overwhelming</p>

	<p>However, there are few or no opportunities for further development,
	increased rather than decreased maintenance costs. Furthermore, there
	are hardly any useful lesson to learn, and the cost of migrating
	another site will only be marginally lower than the first one since
	all them are unique.</p>

	<p>There will also be a substantial amount of work that cannot be
	automated.</p>

      </div>


      <div>

	<h2 id="paths">4. Migration paths</h2>

	<p>There are different ways we can migrate objects into the new platform.</p>

	<h3>3.1. Directly to SIFD</h3>

	<p>All objects that are</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>cataloged in OPAC (Aleph)</li>
	  <li>mainly non-image data</li>
	</ul>

	<p>are most readily migrated directly into SIFD. These are (for
	instance) sheet music in PDF, the objects in the permalink application.</p>

	<p>A possible exception could be H.C. Andersen dairies and the Guaman
	Poma website. These are based mainly on TEI data and could be migrated
	as a part of a TEI data project together with ADL.</p>

	<h3>3.2. To SIFD via Cumulus (and consequently possibly COP)</h3>

	<p>Material that are mainly image data and that delivered via Erez
	should be migrated via COP.</p>

	<p>A special case are those objects stored in Cumulus, but with better
	metadata in Aleph than in Cumulus itself.</p>

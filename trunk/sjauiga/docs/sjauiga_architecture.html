    <h2>Architecture</h2>

      <p>The Manus application has its original editoral interface
      intact. Library staff can continue to enter data as they have for
      several years, and thereby create new Manus documents.</p>

      <p>The data entered are stored in the Manus (Oracle) application,
      originally built using Oracle Designer which is no longer supported in
      the technical platform of the Royal Library.</p>

      <p>Sjauiga is partly a Java application built on top of the old oracle
      database, partly a completely independent one. In the graph, anything
      from cataloging up to and including the XWS layer are built on top of
      our RDBMS.</p>

      <p>The remaining system components are built using other
      technologies.</p>

      <p>Data are exported from Manus, Mus and Musman applications
      using a REST XML web service. The export format is METS using
      MODS for item level metadata. Data are cached in a file system
      and is available from there using HTTP. The documents are
      delivered by the CMS, but there are not really any special
      facilities for using the data within the CMS.</p>

      <p>It is easy to link to any object through a permanent linking
      structure. METS documents are also indexed for searching.</p>

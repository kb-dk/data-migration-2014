    <h2>mods &amp; mets in manus</h2>

    <p>The choice of mods &amp; mets were taken early, actually before the
    onset of the project. (The intention was stated clearly in our project
    plan's <a href="../implementation.plan.out.html#intro.problems">Executive
    Summary</a>). Similar conclusions have been reached and elaborated in
    reports from JISC's <a
    href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/services/services_techwatch/techwatch.aspx">Technology
    and Standards Watch</a>: Please refer to Richard Gartner, 2003, <a
    href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/services/services_techwatch/techwatch/techwatch_report_0306.aspx">MODS:
    Metadata Object Description Schema</a> and by the same author, 2002, <a
    href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/services/services_techwatch/techwatch/techwatch_report_0205.aspx">METS:
    Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard</a>.</p>

    <p>Gartner conclusion is that "<em>METS offers a coherent overall
    structure for encoding all relevant types of metadata (descriptive,
    administrative and structural) used to describe digital library
    objects</em>". That is, METS is good for digital library objects but that
    does not mean that it is necessarily good for, say, medieval
    manuscripts. Simply because manuscripts are not digital library
    objects. We will return to this problem at the end of this document.</p>


    <h3>A note on our implementation of mets &amp; mods</h3>

    <p>The formal definition of each mets section below (in fine
    print, italics) are quoted from <a
    href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/METSDocumentationdraft8.30.pdf">http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/METSDocumentationdraft8.30.pdf</a></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<p><strong>Descriptive Metadata</strong></p>
	<blockquote>
	  This section contains either descriptive metadata that is
	  external to the METS document (e.g., a MARC record in an
	  OPAC or an MODS record maintained on a WWW server), contains
	  internally embedded descriptive metadata, or both. Multiple
	  instances of both external and internal descriptive metadata
	  may be included in the descriptive metadata section.
	</blockquote>
	<p>We are using MODS. Because of the datamodel used in the legacy
	application, and the because of the cataloging practices that has
	arisen we have the following kind of data in one or two languages:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>author (occasionally). Author was mandatory in manus, and since
	  the author are often unknown there are misleading texts in this field.</li>
	  <li>title of the digitized work. Usually correct</li>
	  <li>description, or rather introductory text</li>
	  <li>language of the work, but the language is sometimes misleading
	  since it is often replaced by the language of the metadata.</li>
	  <li>annotations, i.e., notes on individual pages or parts of
	  pagen. Some of these are made in the global annotation.</li>
	  <li>collection and project information</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>We do not have</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Date and place of origin. Because of the age of the material,
	  exact dates are seldom known. We need something which is
	  functionally equivalent with <a
	  href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/html/MS.html#msdo">TEI
	  P5 MS origin</a>:
	  <pre>
&lt;origin>
  &lt;p>Written in &lt;origPlace>Durham&lt;/origPlace> during 
  &lt;origDate notBefore="1125" notAfter="1175">the mid-twelfth century&lt;/origDate>.
  &lt;/p>
&lt;/origin></pre>
	  This is structured data which can be used for search and
	  navigation, but there is no way to express this as eloquently in
	  mods or marc.
  	  </li>
	</ul>

      </li>
      <li>
	<p><strong>Administrative Metadata</strong></p>
	<blockquote>
	  The administrative metadata section provides information
	  regarding how the files were created and stored,
	  intellectual property rights, metadata regarding the
	  original source object from which the digital library object
	  derives, and information regarding the provenance of the
	  files comprising the digital library object (i.e.,
	  master/derivative file relationships, and
	  migration/transformation information). As with descriptive
	  metadata, administrative metadata may be either external to
	  the METS document, or encoded internally.
	</blockquote>
	<p>This section is currently not used in SJAUIGA</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p><strong>File Groups</strong></p>
	<blockquote>
	  The file group section lists all files comprising all electronic
	  versions of the digital object. File group elements may nest, to
	  provide for subdividing the files by object version.
	</blockquote>
	<p>File Groups are used extensively in SJAUIGA. All image
	files has an entry in a file group. The various alternative
	view files (enlarged, rotated and whatever) are stored in a
	seperate file group.</p>
      </li>

     <li>
       <p><strong>Structural Map</strong></p>
       <blockquote>
	 The structural map is the heart of a METS document. It
	 outlines a hierarchical structure for the digital library
	 object, and links the elements of that structure to content
	 files and metadata that pertain to each element.
       </blockquote>
       <p>It is common to create two structural maps, one for the
       logical and one for the physical structure of a work. The
       current version SJAUIGA only addresses the physical structure
       of works.</p>

       <p>We encountered a problem, which we at the time had difficulties to
       solve. Mets encodes document structure a nested hierarchy of elements
       called div. The div element may contain other div elements, and
       pointers to entries in the file group and metadata sections. Here is a
       number of div elements:</p>

<pre>
&lt;m:div ID="manus:7:div:physical:792" xml:lang="eng" ORDERLABEL="Leaf (with flap)">
   &lt;m:fptr FILEID="file:default:7:792"/>
&lt;/m:div>
&lt;m:div ID="manus:7:div:physical:792" xml:lang="ara" ORDERLABEL="وجه الغلاف">
   &lt;m:fptr FILEID="file:default:7:792"/>
&lt;/m:div>
</pre>

       <p>We need two divs, since we need both the English phrase <em>Leaf
       (with flap)</em> and the corresponding one in Arabic, وجه الغلاف, to
       build the user interface. We made the mistake to interprete the ID as
       an identifier of the digital object, and to extract the data needed we
       need language as well as this ID. This has complicated a lot of
       programming at later stages in the project and it is also an XML
       error. A small change (in red below) had made the divs unique and our
       programming easier.</p>

<pre>
&lt;m:div ID="manus:7:div:physical:792:<span style="color:red">eng</span>" xml:lang="eng" ORDERLABEL="Leaf (with flap)">
   &lt;m:fptr FILEID="file:default:7:792"/>
&lt;/m:div>
&lt;m:div ID="manus:7:div:physical:792:<span style="color:red">ara</span>" xml:lang="ara" ORDERLABEL="وجه الغلاف">
   &lt;m:fptr FILEID="file:default:7:792"/>
&lt;/m:div>
</pre>


     </li>

     <li>
       <p><strong>Structlink Section</strong></p>
       <blockquote>
	 Structural Links allows the creator of the METS document to
	 record the existence of hyperlinks between nodes in the
	 hierarchy outlined in the Structural Map. This is of
	 particular value in using METS to archive Websites or other
	 hypermedia.
       </blockquote>

       <p>Used extensively in SJAUIGA to encode links between different views
       (enlarged, rotated etc). It had been easier to use them had we not made
       the mistake described above.</p>

     </li>
     <li>
       <p><strong>Behavior</strong></p>
       <blockquote>
	 A behavior section can be used to associate executable
	 behaviors with content in the METS object. A behavior section
	 has an interface definition element that represents an
	 abstract definition of the set of behaviors represented by a
	 particular behavior section. A behavior section also has a
	 behavior mechanism which is a module of executable code that
	 implements and runs the behaviors defined abstractly by the
	 interface definition.
